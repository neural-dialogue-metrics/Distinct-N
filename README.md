# Distinct-N

Distinct-N, most notably distinct-1 and distinct-2, is a metric that measures the
diversity of a sentence. It focuses on the number of *distinct* n-grams of a sentence and thus
penalizes sentences with lots of repeated words. The metric is free of any *reference* or *ground truth*
sentence and devotes totally to the property of a sentence (generated by the system).
It is proposed by Jiwei Li et.al in the paper *A Diversity-Promoting Objective Function for Neural Conversation Models*.

# Definitions

The original paper coined *Distinct-N* as:

    We report the degree of diversity by calculating the number of distinct unigrams and bigrams in generated responses.
    The value is scaled by the total number of generated tokens to avoid favoring long sentences
    
which is exactly what we have mentioned before.
